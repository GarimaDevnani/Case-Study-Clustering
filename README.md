## Introduction
A case study to perform model selection for clustering. In this case study, the model selection is executed for 2 image representation datasets of tissue patches, resulting in 2 best models out of the initial 4 models considered. The initial models considered are as follows - 
1. K-Means Clustering
2. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
3. Hierarchical clustering
4. Louvain Clustering

## System and Environment Requirements
To run this project, your system needs the following software - 
1. Jupyter Notebook (via Anaconda Navigator)/Google Collab
2. Python 3.7 or above (Packages - numpy, matplotlib.pyplot and sklearn (scikit-learn))

## Dataset
5,000 colorectal cancer tissue patche images. It consists of 9 tissue types including - 
 * Adipose (ADI)
 * background (BACK)
 * debris (DEB)
 * lymphocytes (LYM)
 * mucus (MUC)
 * smooth muscle (MUS)
 * normal colon mucosa (NORM)
 * cancer-associated stroma (STR)
 * colorectal adenocarcinomaepithelium (TUM)
